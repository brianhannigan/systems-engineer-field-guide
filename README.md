## Architecture & Workflow Diagrams

This repository is organized around practical systems engineering workflows used in security-conscious enterprise and government environments.
It combines operational runbooks, security-aware workflows, and infrastructure validation practices into a portfolio-grade systems engineering knowledge base. The diagrams below highlight the core operating model, change-control thinking, and infrastructure lifecycle represented throughout the guide.

### Infrastructure Architecture
![](assets/infrastructure_architecture.svg)

This diagram shows the high-level systems stack represented in the repository:
- Azure / cloud resource layer
- Linux and Windows server operations
- Terraform automation and repeatable deployment
- STIG hardening and compliance alignment
- monitoring, logging, and validation
- vulnerability remediation and closure workflows

---

### Security Incident Workflow
![](assets/security_incident_workflow.svg)

This workflow visualizes how operational engineering and security response intersect:
- alert validation
- affected system identification
- severity and scope determination
- containment and root cause investigation
- remediation and service recovery
- security and stability validation
- lessons learned and evidence capture

---

### Terraform Deployment Flow
![](assets/terraform_deployment_flow.svg)

This diagram shows a disciplined infrastructure-as-code path:
- author or update Terraform code
- format and validate configuration
- review `terraform plan`
- approve changes
- apply safely
- validate resources after deployment
- confirm state and drift posture
