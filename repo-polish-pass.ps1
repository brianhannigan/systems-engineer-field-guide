# Systems Admin First 90 Days Field Guide

> A portfolio-grade systems administration field guide focused on Linux, Azure, Terraform, STIG hardening, patching, upgrades, vulnerability remediation, and practical single-VM lab workflows.

## What this project is

This repository is a structured operational handbook for ramping into a mixed infrastructure Systems Administrator role.

It is designed to show practical, production-minded thinking across:

- Red Hat Linux administration
- Windows/Linux mixed infrastructure support
- Azure infrastructure operations
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- STIG hardening and troubleshooting
- Server upgrades and patch validation
- Vulnerability remediation workflows
- Single-VM cyber range practice

## What this demonstrates

This project is intended to demonstrate:

- structured systems thinking
- operational troubleshooting discipline
- security-aware administration
- documentation maturity
- practical lab-driven learning
- compliance-aware infrastructure support

# Tools

This folder contains helper scripts used to scaffold, expand, and polish the repository.

These scripts support repo development, but they are intentionally separated from the root so the main project presentation emphasizes the field guide itself rather than scaffolding utilities.

## Suggested usage
- run builders intentionally
- review file changes before commit
- keep generated documentation aligned with real-world notes
