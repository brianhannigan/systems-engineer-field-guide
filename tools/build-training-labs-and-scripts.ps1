# Bash

## Purpose
Capture Bash patterns useful for Linux administration and health checks.

## Common Use Cases
- disk usage checks
- failed service checks
- uptime and host context
- package status review
- quick evidence capture

## Example Health Check
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== Hostname ==="
hostname

echo "=== Uptime ==="
uptime

echo "=== Disk Usage ==="
df -h

echo "=== Failed Services ==="
systemctl --failed || true
```

## Script Design Rules
- fail clearly
- avoid silent destructive actions
- log useful output
- make validation obvious
- keep scripts readable

## Validation
- script runs cleanly
- output is understandable
- failures are visible
'@

$powershellDoc = @'
# PowerShell

## Purpose
Capture PowerShell patterns useful for Windows administration and inventory.

## Common Use Cases
- running service checks
- server inventory
- event log review
- patch or version checks
- quick environment reporting

## Example Inventory Script
```powershell
Write-Host "=== Computer Info ==="
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object CsName, WindowsProductName, OsVersion

Write-Host "`n=== Running Services ==="
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | Select-Object -First 20

Write-Host "`n=== Disk Usage ==="
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem
```

## Script Design Rules
- be explicit with output
- avoid hidden assumptions
- prefer readable objects when possible
- capture before/after evidence for changes

## Validation
- output is meaningful
- script is safe to run repeatedly
- no unnecessary side effects
'@

$terraformDoc = @'
# Terraform

## Purpose
Document the practical Terraform command flow and safe usage habits.

## Core Workflow

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## Admin Rules

- read the plan before apply
- understand target subscription or environment
- avoid casual state manipulation
- treat destroy carefully

## Common Notes to Capture
- provider requirements
- variable file usage
- state location
- module dependencies
- output interpretation

## Validation
- plan is understood
- apply matches expectation
- cleanup is deliberate
'@

$azureCliDoc = @'
# Azure CLI

## Purpose
Capture useful Azure CLI commands for inventory, validation, and troubleshooting.

## Common Use Cases

- review NSGs
- review role assignments
- check monitoring-related resources

## Example Commands
```bash
az account show
az group list -o table
az vm list -o table
az network nsg list -o table
az role assignment list --all -o table
```

## Usage Rules
- confirm subscription context first
- prefer read-only commands when investigating
- capture outputs for evidence when useful
- avoid destructive commands without validation

## Validation
- command output matches expected environment
- subscription and scope are correct
'@

$troubleshootingDoc = @'
# Troubleshooting

## Purpose
Track script and command patterns that support repeatable troubleshooting.

## Common Areas
- failed services
- ports not listening

- bad config
- network reachability
- post-patch validation

## Example Linux Triage Commands
```bash
systemctl --failed
journalctl -xe
ss -tulpn
df -h
ip addr
ip route
```

## Example Windows Triage Commands
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Running"}
Get-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 50
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem
ipconfig /all
```

## Documentation Rules
- record what symptom triggered investigation
- record what command proved the issue
- record what fixed it
- record how success was validated

## Validation
- troubleshooting steps are repeatable
- commands are organized by symptom or subsystem
