# Systems Admin First 90 Days Field Guide

A portfolio-grade systems administration operations guide focused on:

- Red Hat Linux administration
- Windows and Linux mixed infrastructure support
- Azure infrastructure operations
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- STIG hardening and compliance
- Server upgrades and patching
- Vulnerability remediation
- Single-VM cyber range practice labs

## Why this project exists

This repository was created as a structured operational training system for a new Systems Administrator role in a mixed enterprise environment. The goal is to provide a practical, field-ready knowledge base that can be expanded over time into a real operational handbook.

## Who this is for

- Systems Administrators
- Infrastructure Engineers
- DevOps / Platform Engineers
- Security-minded administrators
- Professionals supporting regulated or compliance-driven environments

## Repository map

- `/docs` → field guide chapters
- `/labs` → hands-on single-VM exercises
- `/scripts` → admin automation examples
- `/diagrams` → architecture and workflow visuals
- `/assets` → images, banners, screenshots

## Core focus areas

- Linux troubleshooting
- Terraform learning path
- Azure administration
- STIG troubleshooting
- Patch / upgrade workflows
- Vulnerability management
- Practical single-VM training

## Suggested development order

1. STIG hardening
2. Linux administration
3. Terraform
4. Azure
5. Vulnerability management
6. Labs and scripts
7. Visual diagrams and repo polish

## Roadmap

See:
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- [PROJECT_BOARD.md](PROJECT_BOARD.md)
- [docs/MASTER_OUTLINE.md](docs/MASTER_OUTLINE.md)

## Status

This repository is being developed as an operations-focused infrastructure learning and portfolio project.
