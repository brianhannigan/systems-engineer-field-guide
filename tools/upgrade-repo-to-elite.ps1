# Infrastructure Overview

## Purpose

This document describes a representative infrastructure model for enterprise systems administration across on-premises and cloud-connected environments.

## Core Components

- Linux servers supporting applications, automation tasks, and services
- Windows servers supporting directory, management, and enterprise workloads
- Azure services for cloud-hosted infrastructure and monitoring
- Centralized logging and monitoring to support operations and incident response
- Security controls aligned to STIG and vulnerability remediation workflows

## Administrative Priorities

1. Maintain system availability
2. Apply patches safely and consistently
3. Validate backups and rollback options
4. Maintain secure baselines
5. Document operational decisions and changes

## Example Platform Model

- Entry point: Load balancer or management access tier
- Compute: Linux and Windows server fleet
- Cloud: Azure-hosted services and virtual machines
- Logging: central pipeline for system and security events
- Security: STIG hardening, patching, scanning, and remediation
'@

$loggingArchitecture = @'
# Logging Architecture

## Objective

Provide a reliable path for collecting, transporting, and reviewing system and security logs.

## Logging Pipeline

1. Server or workload generates logs
2. Log collection agent forwards events
3. Logs are centralized in a storage or analytics platform
4. Monitoring and SIEM tooling alert on anomalies or failures

## Recommended Log Sources

- Linux system logs
- Windows Event Logs
- authentication events
- service failures
- patching activity
- audit logs
- Azure activity logs
- vulnerability scan summaries

## Validation Checklist

- confirm agent service is running
- confirm logs are being forwarded
- confirm timestamps are correct
- confirm log retention settings
- confirm critical events are searchable
'@

$monitoringArchitecture = @'
# Monitoring Architecture

## Goal

Enable proactive detection of system health, performance degradation, and service outages.

## Monitoring Domains

- CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- service availability
- failed logons and security alerts
- patching success/failure
- Azure VM health
- backup job success
- certificate expiration
- filesystem growth trends

## Escalation Model

- warning: investigate during business hours
- critical: immediate triage
- outage: incident workflow and service restoration process

## Operational Notes

Monitoring must be tied to actionable runbooks. Every alert should map to a clear troubleshooting path.

# High CPU Investigation

## Initial Triage

### Linux

    uptime
    top
    ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
    journalctl -p 3 -xb

### Windows

    Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 15
    Get-Counter '\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time'

## Investigation Questions

- is the CPU spike sustained or transient?
- is a single process responsible?
- was there a recent deployment, patch, or config change?
- is the system under legitimate workload demand?

## Common Causes

- runaway process
- memory leak
- failed service restart loop
- scan or backup overload
- unexpected user/application demand

## Response Options

- restart offending service if approved
- scale resources if cloud-hosted and justified
- roll back recent change
- isolate workload for deeper investigation
'@

$diskFull = @'
# Disk Full Remediation

## Linux

    journalctl --disk-usage

## Windows

    Get-Volume | Sort-Object SizeRemaining
    Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object -First 50

## Remediation Steps

- identify growth path
- remove temporary or stale files where approved
- rotate or archive logs
- extend storage if needed
- confirm application recovery after cleanup

## Prevention

- alert on filesystem thresholds
- review retention settings
- validate log rotation
'@

$serviceDown = @'
# Service Down Troubleshooting

## First Checks

- determine whether the outage is local or broad
- check monitoring alert details
- identify last known good time

## Linux

    systemctl status <service-name>
    journalctl -u <service-name> -n 100
    ss -tulpn

## Windows

    Get-Service -Name <service-name>
    Get-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 100
    netstat -ano

## Decision Tree

1. service not running -> attempt controlled restart
2. port not listening -> inspect config and dependencies
3. dependency failure -> restore dependency first
4. recurring failure -> collect logs and escalate
'@

$serverNotBooting = @'
# Server Not Booting
