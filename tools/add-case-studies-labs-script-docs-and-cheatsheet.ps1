# Case Study — STIG Remediation Project

## Problem
A system baseline required STIG hardening and vulnerability remediation, but changes had to be applied carefully to avoid breaking administrative access and production functionality.

## Environment
- Government / compliance-focused environment
- Linux and/or Windows systems
- Formal validation expectations
- Security scanning and remediation workflow in place

## Goals
- Improve compliance posture
- Reduce open findings
- Preserve service availability
- Capture repeatable validation evidence

## Approach
1. Review findings and group by operational impact
2. Identify which controls affect authentication, networking, logging, and services
3. Stage changes in a safe order
4. Validate service health after each major change group
5. Capture evidence for remediation closure
6. Update documentation and exceptions as needed

## Outcome
Document the practical results:
- Reduced open findings
- Improved hardening posture
- Fewer repeated remediation issues
- Better validation process

## Lessons Learned
- Hardening must be paired with service validation
- SSH, RDP, logging, and identity-related controls deserve special care
- Evidence collection should happen during the work, not after
"@

$caseStudyUpgrade = @"
# Case Study — Server Upgrade Lifecycle

## Problem
A server required an in-place upgrade or major version uplift while maintaining operational continuity and minimizing rollback risk.

## Environment
- Enterprise or government-managed system
- Maintenance window required
- Hardening and patching dependencies present
- Monitoring and validation required after completion

## Goals
- Complete the upgrade safely
- Preserve service availability
- Validate compatibility, security posture, and logging
- Document recovery steps if rollback is needed

## Approach
1. Capture current state and backup / snapshot information
2. Validate prerequisites and package health
3. Execute upgrade in a controlled window
4. Validate services, ports, logs, and dependencies
5. Confirm monitoring and security tooling return to healthy state
6. Record findings and lessons for the next upgrade cycle

## Outcome
Document measurable improvements:
- New supported version
- Reduced operational risk
- Improved standardization
- Clearer runbook for future upgrades

## Lessons Learned
- Pre-checks reduce emergency troubleshooting
- Service dependency maps matter
- Validation should be structured, not improvised

$caseStudyTerraform = @"
# Case Study — Terraform Deployment Standardization

## Problem
Cloud resources were being deployed inconsistently across environments, increasing drift and troubleshooting effort.

## Environment
- Azure resources
- Terraform-managed infrastructure
- Shared engineering ownership
- Need for repeatable deployment and validation

## Goals
- Make deployments consistent
- Reduce manual changes
- Improve auditability
- Shorten recovery and rebuild time

## Approach
1. Define reusable modules and variable structure
2. Establish naming, tagging, and environment conventions
3. Validate with terraform fmt, validate, and plan
4. Apply changes through a repeatable workflow
5. Validate deployed resources and capture evidence
6. Monitor for drift and correct process gaps

## Outcome
Document improvements such as:
- More predictable deployments
- Better consistency across environments
- Easier troubleshooting
- Improved change confidence

## Lessons Learned
- Drift control requires both tooling and process
- Clear variable naming prevents mistakes
- Post-apply validation is mandatory

# Lab — STIG Hardening Validation

## Objective
Practice validating whether a hardening change improves compliance without breaking access or core services.

## Environment
- RHEL lab VM or equivalent
- SSH access
- Logging enabled
- SCAP / compliance tooling if available

## Prerequisites
- Admin access
- Snapshot or rollback plan
- Basic service baseline captured before changes

## Steps
1. Record current service and access state
2. Apply a controlled hardening-related change
3. Validate SSH, service health, and logging
4. Review whether the change introduces operational issues
5. Roll back or document the safe final state

## Validation
- SSH still works
- Service remains available
- Logs are clean enough for follow-up review
- Compliance position improves or is clearly understood

## Cleanup
Revert the lab change or restore the snapshot if needed.

$labTerraform = @"
# Lab — Terraform Azure Deployment Validation

## Objective
Practice running a clean Terraform workflow and validating deployed Azure resources.

## Environment
- Azure lab subscription
- Terraform installed
- Test resource group or isolated environment

## Prerequisites
- Azure CLI access
- Terraform project files
- Safe non-production target scope

## Steps
1. Authenticate to Azure
2. Run terraform fmt
3. Run terraform validate
4. Run terraform plan
5. Run terraform apply
6. Validate deployed resources with Azure CLI
7. Run terraform plan again to confirm expected state

## Validation
- Resources deploy successfully
- terraform plan behaves as expected after apply
- Naming and tags are correct
- Resource health is visible in Azure

## Cleanup
Destroy or remove test resources if they are no longer needed.

$labMonitoring = @"
# Lab — Linux Monitoring and Log Validation

## Objective
Practice validating service health, logs, and host state after a change or restart.

## Environment
- Linux VM
- systemd-managed service
- Local logs or journal available

## Prerequisites
- Administrative access
- Test service or known daemon to inspect

## Steps
1. Check current service status
2. Review recent logs
3. Restart the service
4. Confirm the service returns healthy
5. Validate listening ports and basic connectivity
6. Capture output as evidence

## Validation
- Service starts cleanly
- No major errors appear in logs
- Required port is listening
- Basic connectivity checks succeed

## Cleanup
Return the lab system to its baseline if any configuration was changed.
